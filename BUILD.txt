Notes on building / installing:

Client:

Client side is exported as Web (runnable).  Some extra stuff is added into the
custom html header to get a thumbnail preview for links.  Also set no cache
on the page, which (if I read online correctly) will force browsers to
re-download the context if it's updated (e.g. for bug fixes).

E.g., something like this in the Head Include section:

<meta property="og:title" content="Nasercar">
<meta property="og:description" content="GVH kart racing game.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://mikeasaurus.github.io/nasercar/preview2.png" >
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache">

Need to manually copy the "preview*.png" file to the web server.

Also, enable virtual keyboard to help with mobile devices.  Mobile browsers
don't react to Godot's text boxes with their native virtual keyboard, so
Godot has to provide its own keyboard.

Server:

Multiplayer server is exported as Linux (runnable).
When launching the server, use options --headless --max-fps=45

This avoids initializing a display (which may not even exist on a VPS!), and
tones down the FPS.  Too many FPS, and the Websocket communication gets all
wonky.  However, too few FPS makes it too choppy/slow to play.  45 seems like
a good number after some tests.


Remember to uncheck "DEBUG" when exporting both client / server parts.
